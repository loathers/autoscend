# "drop" type is used when we want to grab a familiar that drops items themselves rather than boosting the odds of the enemy dropping items.
#
# First we grab up to small amount of various specific drops.

# every 10 yellow pixels make a size 2 density 5 food or drink. unlimited drops per day. prioritize having enough to craft 2.
# drops 1 per combat with chance of 2nd if wearing familiar specific equip

# 1st wax drop per run only takes 5 combats, afterwards 30. makes a single size 2 density 4.25 food or drink

#
# Below this lines drops are not needed more of for the run and are just grabbing for profit.
# Most are useful in limited amounts which we already grab via boolean autoChooseFamiliar(location place)
#
# density 1.875 size 4 spleen consumables. boolean autoChooseFamiliar(location place) will already grab the amount needed for spleen
# Here they are only used to grab extras.
