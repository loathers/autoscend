# Typical starfish are better than whelps
# Whelps on average restore .375*(weight+5)
# Superwhelps up this to 0.75*(weight+5)
# But starfish restore roughly 0.25*weight PER TURN
# and average combat length looks to be ~6 rounds in sl_ascend, so that's 1.5*weight on average
# Not even bothering with cocoabos
