Can be set to any of the 9 main sign names, or knoll/canadia/gnomad to automatically select the appropriate sign within that zone based on your mainstat. Also some shorthands are allowed in case you forgot which moonsign is which, such as famweight/clover/food/booze. You will be prompted to confirm that you actually do want to change signs automatically once per ascension (although it will automatically assume that you do after 15 seconds of inactivity), so forgetting to change the value in advance should not be a concern.
auto_MLSafetyLimit	integer	If set this will be the (approximate) cap for +ML. WARNING: Certain conditions may require the script to exceed this by a small margin. For best results set this 10 below the maximum ML you can handle. Setting to -1 will cause the lowest possible ML to be equipped, including going negative if possible - this can cause non-optimal gear to be equipped.
auto_disregardInstantKarma	boolean	When true, the script will not scale back ML after reaching Level 13, if you also set auto_MLSafetyLimit to 999 the script will passively power level.
