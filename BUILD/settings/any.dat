auto_spoonsign	string	What sign to change to with the hewn moon-rune spoon after finishing any business in the current sign. If blank or invalid, we won't switch automatically. Can be set to any of the 9 main sign names, or knoll/canadia/gnomad to automatically select the appropriate sign within that zone based on your mainstat.
